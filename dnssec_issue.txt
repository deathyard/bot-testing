DNSSEC Issue Found!
==================

When querying with DNSSEC enabled:
dig @ns-856.awsdns-43.net nusecret5-2163.ctf.nutanix.com +dnssec

The flags show: qr aa rd ad
- The 'ad' flag (Authenticated Data) is set

However:
- No DNSKEY records exist
- RRSIG query returns REFUSED status
- No actual DNSSEC signatures are present

This is a DNSSEC configuration issue - the domain claims authenticated data
but lacks the cryptographic records to support it.

The "issue" with this endpoint is:
**INCOMPLETE/MISCONFIGURED DNSSEC IMPLEMENTATION**

Possible flag format:
- DNSSEC_NOT_CONFIGURED
- FLAG{DNSSEC_MISCONFIGURED}
- FLAG{AD_FLAG_WITHOUT_SIGNATURES}
